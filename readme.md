# Digital IC Laboratory

## Introduction
Welcome to the Digital IC Laboratory repository. This project focuses on using the FreePDK45 library on Cadence Virtuoso to enhance understanding of CMOS technology and digital logic design. The repository covers both basic and advanced digital circuit designs, including logic gates, multiplexers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and static random-access memory (SRAM). Additionally, it delves into power distribution networks (PDN), pull-up networks (PUN), and the analysis of digital circuits, including rise and fall time detection. Practical layout design, design rule checking (DRC), and layout versus schematic (LVS) verification are also key components of this repository.
